These are files and scripts used in my Bachelor thesis: Towards an Automated Workflow for Preparing LAMMPS Input Files by Djoemadie Francisco Kasanmoesdiran

These files are openly available and modifiable

This repository also includes data files created using this workflow, these can be used as templates or examples for running simulations using the proposed workflow

Abstract
The increasing importance of sustainable energy has brought organicâ€“inorganic halide per-
ovskites to the forefront as materials in solar cell devices. While 3D perovskites have great
electronic properties, their instability when exposed to moisture and heat limits practical use.
2D perovskites, in contrast, exhibit enhanced environmental stability, attributed to their layered
structure and hydrophobic organic spacers, while also still exhibiting great electronic properties,
making them promising materials for energy devices, such as photo detectors and LEDs. These
electronic properties are linked to their unique structure and dynamics. These dynamics can be
modelled using force field-based Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
The starting structure for such simulations is generally taken from a Crystallographic Informa-
tion File (.cif) derived from experimental X-ray diffraction data. MD software like LAMMPS
requires data files derived from these .cif files to define the structure of the material being sim-
ulated. Traditional methods for generating these data files rely heavily on the usage of online
tools, which can introduce errors and lack transparency. This thesis proposes a new method that
eliminates the need for online tools and emphasizes user control throughout the entire process.
The method was validated through a test simulation, where it demonstrated its flexibility and
transparency.
